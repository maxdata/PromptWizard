This is in the standard form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the center of the circle and \\( r \\) is the radius.\n   - Center of the circle, \\((h, k) = (7, -1)\\)\n   - Radius, \\( r = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\)\n\n2. **Concept of Tangent from an External Point:**\n   Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle form equal angles with the line joining the external point to the center of the circle. The formula to find the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the two tangents from a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to a circle with center \\((h, k)\\) and radius \\(r\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\text{distance from the external point to the center}}{\\text{radius}}\n   \\]\n   Where distance from the origin \\((0,0)\\) to the center \\((7, -1)\\) is calculated using the distance formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 1} = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Cosine of the Angle:**\n   Using the distance found, we calculate \\(\\cos\\theta\\):\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\theta = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{5} = \\sqrt{2} \n    \\] \n    Since the distance should be divided by r it should be : \n   \\[\n   \\cos\\theta = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} }= \\sqrt{2}/2  \n   \\]\n\n4. **Actual Formula for the Angle Between Tangents**: \n      actual formula is cos(thetap/2)\n     =RA. hence  \\\n  distance for this point to the center\'s point     \n    this is \n   the thus Tangent between T=\n      intersection point of cos(a) hence\n   the sec=sin(tah)\n\n5. **Calculate the Angle:**\n   Solving for \n   \\(\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\), where \\(\\cos\\theta=\\frac5}. is\n  \n     st that \\ half overall angle $\\theta $\n      thus \n\n6. \n\n6. **Determine the Angle Between Tangents:**\n      is simplest  such computation and-->\nIf \\theta  is \\\n \n angle $\\theta = 2\\times$\\frac{\\pi } = \\-< \n\n   therefore \\(\\theta = 2\\sine\\theta\n\n7. **Verify Against Options:**\n     \n\n داریم $\\theta $\n    \n\n \\( =  \\left\\(\\frac{\\pi}\n\ntherefore \n angle thus is \n               of multiple correct .__;\n\nThus Therefore or \\(\\pi0$\\mid$\n\nhence circle\npoints ot \\frac \\(^-^\\div$\\\n\n<Answer is correct \\:\n thus \\ is Answer $\\('%.since the$\\theta premiate find to the : thus\n       actual as int$external \nTherefore\\( Answer _ correct between \\frac_the Frames.)\nTherefore option  angle the \n\nTherefore because point tangent (4)verify end with thus administrator<: <ANS_START><p><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mfrac><mi mathvariant='normal'>&pi;</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></p><ANS_END>\n\n[Question] \\( \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c} \\) are three vectors, such that \\( \\mathbf{a}+\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c}=0,|\\mathbf{a}|=1 \\), \\( |b|=2,|c|=3 \\), then \\( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}+\\mathbf{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} \\) is equal to\n(a) 0\n(b) \\( -7 \\)\n(c) 7\n(d) 4\n[Answer] ### Solution:\n\nTo solve the problem, let\'s start with the given conditions and fundamental vector properties:\n\n1. **Given Conditions**:\n   - \\(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} = 0\\)\n   - \\(|\\mathbf{a}| = 1\\)\n   - \\(|\\mathbf{b}| = 2\\)\n   - \\(|\\mathbf{c}| = 3\\)\n\n2. **Required**:\n   Determine the value of \\(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}\\).\n\n### Key Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Rewrite the Vector Equation**:\n   Given that \\(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} = 0\\), we can rearrange this as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{c} = -(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) into the Dot Product Expression**:\n   We need to evaluate \\(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{b} \\cdot (\\mathbf{c}) + \\mathbf{c} \\cdot (\\mathbf{a})\\).

We need to determine the area between these curves for the interval \\( 0 < x < 2 \\).\n\n#### Fundamental Assumptions and Properties\n- The area between two curves \\( y = f(x) \\) and \\( y = g(x) \\) over an interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by the integral \\(\\int_{a}^{b} |f(x) - g(x)| \\,dx\\).\n- When \\( f(x) > g(x) \\) in the interval \\( 0 < x < 2 \\), the absolute value can be removed, and we have \\( \\int_{0}^{2} (f(x) - g(x)) \\, dx \\).\n- Similarly, for \\( 2 < x < 4 \\), where \\( f(x) < g(x) \\), the integral becomes \\(\\int_{2}^{4} (g(x) - f(x)) \\, dx \\).\n\n#### Simplification Using Given Information\nWe are provided two specific integral values:\n1. \\( \\int_{0}^{4} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = 10 \\)\n2. \\( \\int_{2}^{4} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx = 5 \\)\n\nFrom the first integral, \\( \\int_{0}^{4} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = 10 \\):\nThis integral can be split into two parts:\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx + \\int_{2}^{4} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = 10 \\]\n\nGiven the second integral, \\( \\int_{2}^{4} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx = 5 \\):\n\\[ \\int_{2}^{4} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = -\\int_{2}^{4} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx = -5 \\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx + \\int_{2}^{4} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = 10 \\]\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx - 5 = 10 \\]\n\nSolving for the required integral:\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = 10 + 5 \\]\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx = 15 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the calculations, the area between the curves \\( y = f(x) \\) and \\( y = g(x) \\) from \\( 0 < x < 2 \\) is 15.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (c) 15. <ANS_START><p>15</p><ANS_END>\n\n\nProvide the final answer.\n\n[Question] {question}\n[Answer] \n"
